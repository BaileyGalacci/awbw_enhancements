# AWBW Helper

"AWBW Helper" is a browser extension that adds some extra functionality to
[Advance Wars By Web](https://awbw.amarriner.com). It currently only supports Chrome.

Its current functionality includes:

1. Keyboard shortcuts for replays.
2. Several enhancements to the move planner, including automatic tracking of unit count, unit value, income, and funds. This includes automatically deducting funds when units are built and adding funds when an "end turn" is simulated. I've cheekily called this "Moveplanner Plus".
3. Bug fixes for existing moveplanner functionality, notably fixing the "broken black boat sprite" issue when loading from savestates and the damage calculator being unable to select units that were built from the move planner build menu.

Feel free to request additonal functionality via a github issue or by contacting me (saltor) in the AWBW discord :)
